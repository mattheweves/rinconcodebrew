<h1>About Splurty</h1>

<p>
	<br />
	Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://gitub.com/mattheweves">Matthew Eves</a>.  This is the first Ruby web application
	I have ever built and I am blown away by the complexity of a simple web application that displays quotes and accepts quotes
	from users of the website. 
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
	I currently work as an Application Consultant for a global time and attendance company, but on mission to get to the guts of how applications
	are developed and how pros work together to build software that changes the world.
